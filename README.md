<h1>NASA Lunabotics Challenge 2025</h1>

<h2>About the Challenge</h2>
- <b>Lunabotics provides accredited institutions of higher learning students an opportunity to apply the NASA systems engineering process to design and build a prototype Lunar construction robot</b>



<h2>My Goal</h2>

- <b>Design and manufacture a wheel with a diameter increased to 11.25 inches, width increased to 3.25 inches, and grouser count increased to at least 12 without significantly increasing the weight  </b>


<h2>Software and Skills</h2>

- <b>SOLIDWORKS</b> 
- <b>Machining</b>
- <b>Milling</b>


<h2>Designs</h2>

<br />
Connector attaches sidewalls together as well as connects grousers to the wheel. The top is rounded to fit the radius of the wheel.<br/>
